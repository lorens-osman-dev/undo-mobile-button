# Undo Mobile Button Plugin for Obsidian

This Obsidian plugin adds an undo button to the file explorer navigation bar on mobile devices, allowing you to quickly undo changes made in the active editor.

The undo button only affects changes made within the editor. It does not undo file system operations.
